The Mysql++ API is copyright 1998 by Kevin Atkinson and is released
under the LGPL license for now.

The intent of doing this is allow developers to use my library to
develop commercial programs and to allow it it be distributed with
commercial databases.

However if you do use it to develop a commercial program a small
donation to me would be greatly appreshated.  Your donation will will
encourage me to continue to work on improving this API and also
encourage me to contune to keep it under the LGPL.  Please send
donations too.

I reserve the right to change the license to future versions of the
library if I do not get suffecent pay-back to my work.  However, it is
my promise to you that it will never become more restrictive than the
GPL (not LGPL) licence.
