This is C++ API  library for MySQL.

Starting based of 1.2, this is now maintained by sinisa@mysql.com
as kevinatk@home.com doesn't have time to support this library anymore. 

He has made sinisa@cytanet.com.cy a new official maintainer, which will
continue to keep mysql++ library under LGPL.


Since October 1999, all maintenance has been transferred to Sinisa
Milivojevic (sinisa@mysql.com).

Since versin 1.1, mysql++ has been prepared to be built with automake and
autoconf. 

This will make compilation and  installation much easier. 

You should cd to the root of source directory and run ./configure.

If that does not help, run autoconf first. 

If you are running it several times, because you have problems, do delete 
config.cache. In case of the problem config.log contains more info on
it's whereabouts.

After configure is run, config.h and Makefiles are generated. 

If you wish to install mysql++ in a root directory other then /usr/local,
you should run configure with --with-prefix=.....

Configure contains description of other switches available.

After running configure, run make and make install. Libs will be
installed in prefix/lib and include files in prefix/include/mysql++.





Since version 1.3 of mysql++, it can no longer be compiled  and built by GNU
compilers older then 2.95. Since version 1.3, mysql++ has been changed to
accomodate changes in 2.95 on various aspects of C++. This prevents it's
building with earlier versions of GNU , like 2.7.xx, 2.8.xx. Also building
by egcs compilers 1.x.x is not supported any more. Although with some
changes in code mysql++ could be built with earlier compilers, running of
such programs would result in their crashing.


It was also noted that on certain SPARC Solaris installation, C++ exceptions
did not work with gcc 2.95.2.

This case was tested and it is established that mysql++ builds and runs
flawlessly with a following version of gcc on Solaris:

gcc version 2.95 19990728 (release)



Recommended building of library and examples is the following one:
automake
autoconf
./configure --with-options-of-your-choice
make
make install
