This is C++ API  library for MySQL.

Starting based of 1.2, this is now maintained by sinisa@cytanet.com.cy
as kevinatk@home.com doesn't have time to support this library anymore. 

He has made sinisa@cytanet.com.cy a new official maintainer, which will
continue to keep mysql++ library under LGPL.


Original information from kevinatk@home.com:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

After several people commented on how my quickie wrapper would be of
little use I decided to go all out and create a full featured
version.

To my knowledge this library requiures gcc 2.8 or egcc or better and of
course the mysql library.

To compile the library and modify the file Configure aproprietly
and type make.

I am working on trying to get this to compile into a library.
However I really don't know what I am doing. If you have some
experense with this please take a look at my makefile and uncomment the
appropriate lines and let me know if I am doing everything right.

For more information please see the manual.

I developed it using egcc ver 1.02 (I think) from the Debian hamm
package with kernel 2.0.33 and a Cryix P150+ cpu.  I am also using
Mysql 3.21.25 that is in the non-free section of the Debian
distribution.

Be sure to let me know what you think.  I depend on your feedback.

Thanks,
I can be reached at kevinatk@home.com

End of original README by Kevin Atkinson


Since October 1999, all maintenance has been transferred to Sinisa
Milivojevic (sinisa@cytanet.com.cy) and Michael Widenius (monty@mysql.com).

Send your feedback to any of these addresses, or even better to the
mailing list mysql-plusplus@lists.mysql.com.

Since versin 1.1, mysql++ has been prepared to be built with automake and
autoconf. 

This will make compilation and  installation much easier. 

You should cd to the root of source directory and run ./configure.

If you are running it several times, because you have problems, do delete 
config.cache. In case of the problem config.log contains more info on
it's whereabouts.

After configure is run, config.h and Makefiles are generated. 

If you wish to install mysql++ in a root directory other then /usr/local,
you should run configure with --with-prefix=.....

Configure contains description of other switches available.

After running configure, run make and make install. Libs will be
installed in prefix/lib and include files in prefix/include/mysql++.


Since version 1.3, mysql++ is fully compliant with latest 2.95.xx series
of compilers.
