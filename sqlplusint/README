All of the header files in this directory (sqlplusint) are internal.
This means that you should never include any of these directly in your
programs as they are subject to change from one release to another.

For those interesting in improving the code the files are laid out in
the following fashion:

name0.hh: Header files ending in a 0.hh generally contains macro
  definitions and other messy stuff.

name1.hh: Header files ending in 1.hh contain just the class as
  functions declarations and really simple inline functions.  A 1.hh
  header file should never include anything but other 1.hh header
  files. 

name2.hh: Header files ending in 2.hh contain inline functions and
  methods.  They should generally only include other 1.hh or 2.hh
  header files however they may also include 3.hh and 4.hh header
  files if, for example, they want to instantiate the necessary
  template functions.

name3.hh: Header files ending in 3.hh contain non-inline template
  functions and methods.

name4.hh: Header files ending in 4.hh contain template functions in
  which are the necessary instances should already be
  instantiated. Thus these should never be included in the end users
  program.  Only within other 4.hh or .cc files in this directory.

name.cc: These contain the actual functions and methods corresponding
  the the appropriate header file.  They may include templates
  provided that the necessary instances will all be instantiated by
  the end of the .cc file

The name1.hh, name2.hh, and name3.hh are all guaranteed to exists if
at least one of them exists so that I don't have to worry about
checking if they exists.  However, they files may contain nothing but

  #include"name<prev number.hh" 

I chose this format to minimize interdependencies and to help better
organize my code.
